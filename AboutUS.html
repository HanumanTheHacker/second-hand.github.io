                <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                <p>
                    We are from FCRIT . We are doing this project, because this project is need of an hour.
                    We believe that making such website will benefit the students financially , also they can talk to their seniors personally because of that they can share a bond with each other , which will benefit them in future.
